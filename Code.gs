/**
 * MULTI-ACTIVITY SPORTS REGISTRATION — GOOGLE SHEETS BACKEND
 * (Gym, Leisure Tennis, Tennis Lessons, Leisure Swimming, Swimming Lessons)
 * ------------------------------------------------------------------
 * One Apps Script project is the JSON backend for FOUR static HTML
 * front-ends that live alongside this file in the repo:
 *   - registration-app.html      (public: Register / Renew / Sign In / Sign Out,
 *                                  covers all 5 activities via an activity picker)
 *   - front-desk-dashboard.html  (main front desk: full approvals for every
 *                                  activity, registration tables, visit logs)
 *   - tennis-front-desk.html     (Leisure Tennis + Tennis Lessons only —
 *                                  read-only registrant data + a Walk-in entry
 *                                  form; cannot approve/reject anything, and
 *                                  has no access to Pending or the Visit Log
 *                                  at all — everything pending, walk-ins
 *                                  included, waits for the main front desk)
 *   - swimming-front-desk.html   (same, for Leisure Swimming + Swimming Lessons)
 *
 * SHEET LAYOUT:
 * - Pending is ONE shared sheet across all 5 activities, distinguished
 *   by an "activity" column (gym / leisureTennis / etc. — see
 *   PENDING_HEADERS). A registration sits here from submission until a
 *   front desk approves or rejects it.
 * - Registrations and Visits are back to ONE SHEET PER ACTIVITY (e.g.
 *   "Registrations - Gym", "Visits - Gym" — see ACTIVITIES below), the
 *   same as the very first version of this project. Once a Pending row
 *   is approved, it's copied into that activity's own Registrations
 *   sheet — see approvePendingRow().
 * - Only Pending is shared; Registrations/Visits are isolated per
 *   activity simply by being different sheets, so there's nothing to
 *   filter — reading "Registrations - Gym" can only ever return Gym
 *   rows. No sheet gets a basic Sheets filter (the little dropdown
 *   arrows on the header row) automatically anymore — it didn't play
 *   well with the merged date-header banner rows on Registrations
 *   sheets (see "DATE-GROUPED REGISTRATIONS SHEETS" below).
 *
 * SETUP (fresh sheet):
 * 1. Create a new Google Sheet (sheets.new).
 * 2. Extensions -> Apps Script. Delete any starter code, paste this
 *    whole file in, save (disk icon / Ctrl+S / Cmd+S).
 * 3. From the function dropdown (next to Run/Debug), select "setup",
 *    click Run. Authorize when asked (Advanced -> "Go to (project)
 *    (unsafe)" -> Allow). This creates the shared Pending sheet plus
 *    each activity's own Registrations/Visits sheets (11 sheets total),
 *    each with the right headers. (The Drive folders — a "Pending
 *    Registration Photos" folder for not-yet-approved photos/
 *    signatures, and a "Registration Photos" folder for approved ones —
 *    are both created automatically the first time they're needed.)
 * 4. Deploy -> New deployment -> gear icon -> Web app.
 *      - Execute as: Me
 *      - Who has access: Anyone
 *    Deploy, authorize if asked (this version also asks for Drive
 *    access, since photos/signatures are saved there), copy the
 *    URL ending in /exec.
 * 5. Paste that URL into SCRIPT_URL in EACH of the four HTML files
 *    listed above — they all talk to the same backend.
 * 6. Any time you edit this file again: Deploy -> Manage deployments
 *    -> pencil icon -> Version: New version -> Deploy, or the live
 *    URL won't see your change.
 *
 * UPGRADING FROM THE ORIGINAL 15-SHEET LAYOUT (one Pending/
 * Registrations/Visits sheet PER activity, e.g. "Pending - Gym"):
 * 1. Paste this file in, save, redeploy (step 6 above).
 * 2. Run migratePendingToSharedSheet() ONCE from the function dropdown.
 *    It copies every row out of the old per-activity Pending sheets
 *    into the new shared Pending sheet, tagged with the right activity.
 *    Additive and safe to re-run (skips anything already present);
 *    never touches or deletes the old sheets. The old per-activity
 *    Registrations/Visits sheets need no migration at all — that's
 *    still exactly the shape this version reads.
 * 3. Once you've checked the shared Pending sheet looks right, you can
 *    run deleteLegacyPendingSheets() to remove the old per-activity
 *    Pending tabs for good (that one's a real, permanent delete — see
 *    its comment).
 *
 * UPGRADING FROM THE FULLY-MERGED LAYOUT (a short-lived version of
 * this project where Pending, Registrations AND Visits were all one
 * shared sheet each, just called "Pending"/"Registrations"/"Visits"):
 * 1. Paste this file in, save, redeploy. Pending needs no migration —
 *    it's already shaped exactly like this version expects it.
 * 2. Run splitSharedRegistrationsAndVisits() ONCE from the function
 *    dropdown. It reads the old shared "Registrations"/"Visits" sheets
 *    and copies each row into its own activity's Registrations/Visits
 *    sheet. Additive and safe to re-run; never touches or deletes the
 *    old shared sheets.
 * 3. Once you've checked the per-activity sheets look right, run
 *    deleteSharedRegistrationsAndVisitsSheets() to remove the old
 *    shared "Registrations"/"Visits" tabs for good (permanent delete).
 *
 * HOW ACTIVITIES WORK:
 * - ACTIVITIES (below) is the single source of truth for the 5
 *   activities: member-code prefix, which categories are offered,
 *   which categories must supply their own ID vs get an
 *   auto-generated code, which duration/plan options exist (with
 *   day-length and, for Swimming Lessons, a session cap), and which
 *   sheets belong to it.
 * - EVERY request (doGet view= and doPost action=) carries an
 *   "activity" key (gym / leisureTennis / leisureSwimming /
 *   tennisLessons / swimmingLessons) that says which activity's
 *   sheets to read/write. There is no cross-activity data — a member
 *   registered for the gym and for tennis lessons is two entirely
 *   separate rows in two entirely separate sheets (possibly with the
 *   same raw ID, if they used their student/staff ID both times).
 *
 * HOW IDENTITY / MEMBER CODES WORK:
 * - idNo is the one field that identifies a member within an
 *   activity: it's what UG Student / UG Staff type in themselves,
 *   and what every other category is auto-assigned the moment they
 *   submit — a random unique code shaped "<prefix><7 digits>", e.g.
 *   G1234567 (Gym), T1234567 (Leisure Tennis), S1234567 (Leisure
 *   Swimming), TL1234567 (Tennis Lessons), SL1234567 (Swimming
 *   Lessons). idNo is also the row's key for approve/reject (paired
 *   with activity on the shared Pending sheet, since a manually-typed
 *   ID can appear on two different activities' rows there), and it's
 *   the "code" a member later types into Sign In / Sign Out.
 * - Because an auto-generated idNo is created at submission (not at
 *   approval), it can serve as the pending row's key right away — but
 *   the app never shows it to the member until their registration is
 *   actually approved, via the Sign In tab's phone-number lookup.
 * - A manually-entered ID (UG Student / UG Staff) is never prefixed —
 *   it's stored exactly as typed. The SAME ID number can legitimately
 *   appear on rows in two different activities' sheets (one person,
 *   two memberships) — that's why every Pending lookup filters by
 *   activity as well as idNo, never idNo alone (a per-activity
 *   Registrations/Visits sheet needs no such filter — the sheet itself
 *   is already scoped to one activity).
 *
 * HOW SWIMMING LESSONS' SESSION CAP WORKS:
 * - Swimming Lessons has exactly ONE plan (no Walk-in): the
 *   "12-Session Package", which is BOTH a 6-week (42-day) window AND
 *   capped at 12 sign-outs, whichever is hit first — see the
 *   "sessionCap" property on that duration in ACTIVITIES, and
 *   isExpired()/getExpiryDate() below. A session only counts as used
 *   once the member SIGNS OUT (not at sign-in — see "checkout" below),
 *   incrementing that member's "sessionsUsed" column in Registrations;
 *   a renewal or fresh approval resets it back to blank.
 *
 * HOW A FAMILY PACKAGE REGISTRATION WORKS:
 * - "Family Package (Max 5)" (FAMILY_CATEGORY) is NOT one row for the
 *   whole family. The person filling out the form becomes one full
 *   row (dob/gender/medical/photo/etc. all captured normally, exactly
 *   like any other registration); every additional family member they
 *   list (up to 4 more, so 5 people total) becomes its own lightweight
 *   row — full name, gender, their relationship to the primary
 *   registrant, and optionally that person's OWN medical conditions
 *   (stored in the same hasMedicalCondition/medicalConditionDetails
 *   columns the primary registrant uses), plus the SAME shared
 *   phone/email/address/emergency-contact — but no separate
 *   dob/photo — each with its own auto-generated member code. All rows
 *   in one family also share one "familyGroupId" (a random ID stamped
 *   at submission), which is what lets doApprove()/doReject() act on
 *   the whole family in one request instead of the front desk having
 *   to approve or reject each member one at a time — see
 *   findRowIndicesByFamilyGroup() below. See the "submit" handler.
 * - Because every row in the family shares one phone number, the Sign
 *   In tab's "lookup" action (phone-number code retrieval) naturally
 *   returns every family member's code at once when the head enters
 *   that shared number — see "lookup" below.
 *
 * DATE-GROUPED REGISTRATIONS SHEETS:
 * - Every approval calls insertRegistrationIntoDateGroup(), which drops the
 *   newly-approved row straight into today's date block on its activity's
 *   Registrations sheet (creating that block at the top if this is the
 *   first approval of the day). This is a cheap, targeted insert — a
 *   single-column note scan plus one insertRowAfter()/insertRowsBefore()
 *   — so grouping is live the moment a registration is approved, including
 *   several back to back for a Family Package.
 * - A renewal is approved through this exact same insert path, as a
 *   brand new row in today's block — the member's prior Registrations
 *   row is left exactly as it was, not edited or removed. So a
 *   member's renewal history simply accumulates as separate rows over
 *   time, each one dated to when it was approved.
 * - regroupAllRegistrations() additionally rebuilds every activity's
 *   Registrations sheet from scratch (sorted newest-date-first, with a
 *   bold, shaded, merged banner row above each date's block) once a night
 *   as part of runNightlyMaintenance() (see installNightlyMaintenanceTrigger()
 *   below). It's a self-healing backstop, not the primary mechanism —
 *   it exists to catch any remaining drift (e.g. a stale banner count
 *   after a row is deleted from a block by something other than the
 *   insert path above) rather than to do the day-to-day grouping work.
 *   A full rebuild is deliberately NEVER run synchronously inside an
 *   approval request — an earlier version of this project did that, and
 *   rewriting/reformatting the whole sheet on every single approval is
 *   what caused approvals to time out with "check the connection".
 *   You can still also run the full rebuild by hand
 *   (Run > regroupAllRegistrations) any time you don't want to wait for
 *   the nightly run.
 *
 * (Photo upload, e-signature, the Excel export, walk-ins, and
 * renew/update-details all work exactly as in the original
 * single-activity version — see the inline comments near each
 * function below.)
